###Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

Data loading and inspection.
Handling missing values.
Data cleaning and formatting.

###Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

What is the overall sales trend?
Which products are top sellers?
What are the peak sales periods?
###Data Analysis
Include some interesting code/features worked with

SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;

###Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.
2.
3.
The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

###Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

###Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
