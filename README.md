### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks are performed:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data transforming and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the customer data to answer key questions, such as:

- Are there patterns or trends in customer exits based on demographics or account features?
- How is customer satisfaction related to the resolution of complaints?
- How does customer age relate to account balance, complaints, and credit card status?

### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The overall customer churn rate was found to be 20.4% among customers between the age group of 51-60 having the highest attrition rate.
2. Churn rate is very high among customers with account balances between $1000-$10,000.
3. High churn rates among customers who purchased more than 3 products and registered complaints.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Implement targeted retention efforts for customers aged 51-60.
- Encourage cross-selling initiatives to broaden product adoption.
- Introduce credit score improvement programs.
- Enhance credit card services to meet evolving customer needs.
- Streamline complaint resolution processes for efficient problem-solving.
- Implement a comprehensive customer loyalty program to recognize and reward long-term relationships, fostering overall customer satisfaction.
