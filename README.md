The objective was to foster a deeper understanding of customer behavior, enabling the formulation of targeted initiatives to improve retention rates and overall customer satisfaction.

###Data Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks are performed:

Data loading and inspection.
Handling missing values.
Data transforming and formatting.

###Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the customer data to answer key questions, such as:

Are there patterns or trends in customer exits based on demographics or account features?
How is customer satisfaction related to the resolution of complaints?
How does customer age relate to account balance, complaints, and credit card status?

###Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The overall customer churn rate was found to be 20.4% among customers between the age group of 51-60 having the highest attrition rate.
2. Churn rate is very high among customers with account balances between $1000-$10,000.
3. High churn rates among customers who purchased more than 3 products and registered complaints.

###Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Implement targeted retention efforts for customers aged 51-60.
- Encourage cross-selling initiatives to broaden product adoption.
- Introduce credit score improvement programs.
- Enhance credit card services to meet evolving customer needs.
- Streamline complaint resolution processes for efficient problem-solving.
